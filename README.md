# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

# Expo folder Structure 
In modern React Native projects, especially those utilizing Expo and its routing conventions, organizing your folder structure is crucial for maintainability and scalability. A common approach involves placing your screens within the `app` directory to leverage Expo Router's file-based routing system. This means each screen corresponds to a file or folder within `app`, and the routing is determined by the file structure.îˆ†

**Folder Structure:**


```
AwesomeProject/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx            // Home screen
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _layout.tsx          // Global layout configuration
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ auth/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.tsx        // Authentication entry point
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ login.tsx        // Login screen
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ signup.tsx       // Signup screen
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ profile/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.tsx        // Profile screen
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ settings/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.tsx        // Settings screen
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Button.tsx           // Reusable button component
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.tsx             // Reusable card component
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useAuth.ts           // Custom authentication hook
â”œâ”€â”€ api/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client.ts            // API client setup (e.g., Axios instance)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ auth.ts              // Authentication-related API calls
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ fonts/
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts             // Constant values used across the app
â”œâ”€â”€ contexts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ AuthContext.tsx      // Authentication context provider
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ helpers.ts           // Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ types/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts             // TypeScript types and interfaces
â”œâ”€â”€ app.json
â”œâ”€â”€ babel.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

**Key Points:**

- **`app/` Directory:** Contains all screen components. The structure within this directory directly maps to your app's navigation paths. For instance, `app/auth/login.tsx` corresponds to the `/auth/login` route. The `_layout.tsx` file can be used to define layouts that wrap around your screens.îˆ†

- **Non-Routable Directories:** Folders like `components`, `hooks`, `api`, etc., are placed outside the `app` directory. These contain reusable logic and UI elements that are not directly associated with a route. This separation ensures that only the contents of the `app` directory are considered for routing, preventing unintended navigation paths.îˆ†

- **API Integration:** The `api/` folder manages all API-related functionalities. For example, `client.ts` can set up your API client (like configuring an Axios instance), and `auth.ts` can define functions for authentication-related API calls. This organization promotes a clear separation of concerns and makes it easier to manage API interactions.îˆ†

By structuring your project in this manner, you align with Expo's routing conventions while maintaining a clean and organized codebase. This setup facilitates scalability and ease of maintenance as your application grows.îˆ†
